        thing.

        Thai Yoga Massage (TYM) uses an energy line system—the Ten Sen—through
        which the body's natural life force flows. Blockages in this life force
        cause aches, pains and disease..

        TYM treats ailments such as headache, knee pain, back, shoulder and neck
        pain, premenstrual tension and others. It is especially effective for
        numbness or loss of feeling in conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, or
        after a stroke, and can help with pain relief during labour.

    Contrary to popular preconceptions, TYM  does not require practitioner or
    receiver to be flexible, athletic or strong. Each treatment is designed to
    suit client needs. As the basic principle is to balance the energy body with
    palming and thumbing techniques, this form of body work can be done on or by
    anyone: young, old, healthy or unwell!

      The first time I tried a Thai Yoga Massage, I was amazed by the results.
      Afterwards I felt light and elated and the aches and pains that I normally
      suffer from were much reduced. They did come back but that is probably the
      signal to book another massage.

      I had never heard of Thai Yoga Massage until a friend recomended it for my
      knee pain. I have had one massage session and my knee felt stronger.  My
      practitioner told me that once my body was accustomed to stretching I
      would be able to do more with confidence.
