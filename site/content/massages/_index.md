        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

testimonials:
  - author: David Keith
    quote: >-
      The first time I tried a Thai Yoga Massage, I was amazed by the results.
      Afterwards I felt light and elated and the aches and pains that I normally
      suffer from were much reduced. They did come back but that is probably the
      signal to book another massage.

      I had never heard of Thai Yoga Massage until a friend recomended it for my
      knee pain. I have had one massage session and my knee felt stronger.  My
      practitioner told me that once my body was accustomed to stretching I
      would be able to do more with confidence.
