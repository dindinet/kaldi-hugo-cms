**Wear comfortable clothing**: Thai Yoga Massage involves a lot of stretching and movement, so it's important to wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing that allows you to move freely.

**Communicate your needs**: Before your session begins, communicate any concerns or physical limitations you may have to the practitioner. This will help the practitioner tailor the massage to your specific needs.

**Avoid eating a heavy meal**: It's best to avoid eating a heavy meal for at least 2-3 hours before the massage. This will help you feel more comfortable during the session.

**Hydrate yourself**: It's important to drink plenty of water before and after your Thai Yoga Massage to help flush out any toxins that may be released during the massage.

**Arrive early**: Arrive early for your appointment so you can fill out any necessary paperwork and relax before the session begins.

**Relax your mind and body**: Try to relax your mind and body before the session begins. Take some deep breaths and focus on the present moment.

By following this advice, you can help ensure that you have a positive and beneficial Thai Yoga Massage experience.
