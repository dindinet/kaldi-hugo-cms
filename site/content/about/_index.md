  Originally from the warm mountains of South East Spain, Elena came to live in the UK about 35 years ago after finishing her University degree in English Philology.
  <br/><br/>
  She worked as a teacher of Spanish and English in both the public and private sectors up until she became a mother.
  <br/><br/>
  Elena is highly self motivated and driven. Her philosophy is firmly rooted in ‘doing things for yourself because nobody is going to do it for you’. 
  <br/><br/>
  After being diagnosed with a chronic illness, Elena searched and discovered her true calling and lifelong passion for learning. A journey that began with a deep dive into naturopathy which then encompassed nutrition therapy, kinesiology, yoga and Ayurveda.
  <br/><br/>
  Elena’s education background is a mixture of self taught and official training courses. She qualified as a yoga teacher in 2014 to better understand what she needed to do to stay healthy and pain free with her mind and body and as a Thai Yoga Massage therapist in 2023. She continues to further her studies in Thai Yoga Massage. She is also certified in Clinical Nutrition (1998).
